<h2>Overview</h2>
<b><i>The problem:</i></b> UH Manoa has over 200 <a href="https://manoa.hawaii.edu/studentlife/involvement/registered-independent-organizations/">Registered Independent Organizations</a>, plus many more that do not have this "official" status but are nonetheless active organizations. Unfortunately, there is no easy way for students to learn (a) what student clubs (both registered and unregistered) exist, what they do, and how to get further involved.
<b><i>The solution:</i></b> The Club Hub application will provide a centralized directory for UH Manoa student clubs. UH Manoa students can login to browse a well organized directory of all current student clubs, with brief descriptions, meeting times and locations, URLs to their websites (if any), contact information for officers, and a few select photos.
<h2>Approach</h2>
Club Hub will have the following roles, requiring a UH ID to register: 
<ul>
   <li>Regular users will be able to browse the directory or create clubs and become club owners.</li>
   <li>Super Admins will ensure site content is appropriate and have higher privileges than club owners.</li>
</ul>
In addition, users will not only be able to view the directory of clubs but also filter the directory to find clubs associated with different areas of interest. For example, "athletic" clubs, "art" clubs, "music" clubs, etc. A club can belong to multiple areas of interest.

Note that some information was randomly generated, e.g., room number, since the source data did not provide such information.</p>

<h2>Community Feedback</h2>
<p>Of the feedback given, DaClub seems to accomplish its objective of being a central directory for UH Manoa's student clubs. The community feedback given points out the site's ease of use and smooth navigation across pages and features. Clubs were presented in a neat and aesthetic fashion. When it came to functionality, the users commented on the minimalistic and intuitive approach in the features, noting how easy it was to sign up, edit profiles, and even changing passwords. As for the design aspects, they were described as organized and simple yet well executed.</p>
<p>The community did highlight some of the site's shortcomings. The most prominent was the lack of a way to quickly sort through clubs via a lack of a bottom or top page button and a proper filter. A recommended improvement was to add a sort based on category like 'computer' for computer science related clubs. Another suggestion talked about chat rooms or bulletins where clubs can post events or news, helping people to get a gaige of what to expect for events rather than just looking at the descriptions.</p>

<h2>Team Contract</h2>

The contract outlines several criteria, such as each memberâ€™s contributions and behaviors, and includes solutions to conflicts that may arise during our time as a group. If a member fails to meet the agreed-upon terms, there will be a process to attempt to de-escalate the situation. If that does not work, it will be escalated to the instructor.
